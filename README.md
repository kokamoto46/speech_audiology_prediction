We created a model to predict changes in the necessity of enteral nutrition for patients with acute stroke. We used this source code to determine the best performing machine learning algorithm.

necessity_of_enteral_nutrition.py: Predictive model for the necessity of enteral nutrition in patients with acute stroke.

severity.py: A model for predicting the severity of dysphagia in patients with acute stroke.

app.py, logostiv_regression_best_model.pkl, scaler.pkl: Files requisite for the GUI of the predictive model.
